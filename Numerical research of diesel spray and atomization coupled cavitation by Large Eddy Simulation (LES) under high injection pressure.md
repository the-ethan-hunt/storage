- Special spray model is applied to study the spray behavior with high injection pressure and micro-hole nozzle.
- To reveal the cavitation in diesel nozzle and its influence on spray and atomization, the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) turbulence model is adopted to detect the cavitation, and then the special spray model coupling the cavitation is built.
- Smagorinskyâ€“Lilly model (Payri et al., 2010, 2011; Piomelli,1999) was used in this paper
- The Schnerr and Sauer model (Yuan et al., 2001), based on the Rayleigh Plesset equation, describe the growth of a single vapor bubble in a liquid. The Schnerr and Sauer cavitation model is highly recommended because of its accordance with all the turbulence models including LES as well as its good robustness and convergence.

### Conclusion

- For high injection pressure, the evolution speed of cavitation layer is faster and the cavitation becomes more intense
inside the nozzle. As a result, the thick cavitation layer attached to the nozzle wall occupied more flow area, which greatly increased the effective velocity at the nozzle exit.
- The spray penetration and cone angle of simulation coupling the cavitation fit very well with the experimental results, while the outcomes of simulation uncoupling the cavitation were largely different from the experiments. Moreover, Spray images of simulations considering cavitation were in accordance with the experimental images. The newly-built spray model is thus able to predict the spray characteristics with better accuracy.
- The velocity at the initial spray center zone uncoupling the cavitation is distinctly bigger than coupling the cavitation at high injection pressure (180 MPa). The cavitation intensity has a great impact on the spray velocity field, especially at the initial spray under the condition of high injection pressure.
- The vorticity of the spray field coupling cavitation is more intense than uncoupling cavitation, particularly in the initial atomization region of the spray.
